# Project: Riyadh Traffic Congestion Prediction

This is a machine learning project that aims to predict the `TrafficIndexLive` in Riyadh, based on a dataset from Kaggle.

The model analyzes historical traffic patterns based on factors such as:
* Time (hour, day, month).
* Historical data (traffic index from a week ago, historical travel time).
* The model was built using a `RandomForestRegressor` and showed good results (Mean R² ~0.98).
